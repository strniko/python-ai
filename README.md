# AIs in Python
Hi this project of mine is to visualise the different types of AIs that you can use in python and how to implement them in your projjects.
Here I am giving examples for all sorts of AI structures from [GAs](#The-Genetic-Algorithm-(GA)) to [NEAT algorithems](#Neuroevolution-of-augmenting-topologies-(NEAT)).
You can find Information about the AI structure in this doc and on the providet Wikipedia link.
